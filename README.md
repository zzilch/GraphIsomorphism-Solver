# GraphIsomorphism-Solver
Algorithms for graph ismorphism testing.

## Algorithm
1. bf.py: Brute force
2. bt.py: Backtracking, one step pruning 
3. pr.py: VF2 algorithm, look-ahead pruning. Based on [the implementation of NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/isomorphvf2.py), but have a better performance.
